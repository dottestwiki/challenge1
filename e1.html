<h1>
Desktop App Challenge
</h1>
<h2>
Secret Leakage!
</h2>

<h3>
In the rush to release the product, the development team made a critical mistake: they hardcoded sensitive secrets directly into the application.
Shortly after the product's release, an attacker discovered the secrets embedded in the code. Using these, they launched a series of exploits in real-time, gaining unauthorized access to the system and causing widespread damage.
Despite the product team's efforts to respond, the hardcoding of secrets meant they were unable to immediately rotate credentials or disable the compromised access points, leaving the system vulnerable to ongoing exploitation.
